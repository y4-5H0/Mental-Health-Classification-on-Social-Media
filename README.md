### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/y4-5H0/Mental-Health-Classification-on-Social-Media.git
cd Mental-Health-Classification-on-Social-Media
```

### Step 2: Create Virtual Environment (Recommended)

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Step 3: Install Required Packages

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or install packages individually:
```bash
pip install streamlit>=1.28.0 pandas>=1.5.0 scikit-learn>=1.3.0 pickle-mixin>=1.0.2 numpy>=1.21.0
```

### Step 4: Run the Application

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The application will open in your default web browser at `http://localhost:8501`.

## üéØ Usage

1. **Launch the Application**: Run `streamlit run app.py` in your terminal
2. **Enter Text**: In the text area, input social media content, thoughts, feelings, or mental health-related text
3. **Analyze**: Click the "üîç Analyze Mental Health Pattern" button
4. **View Classification**: The AI model will analyze the text and provide a mental health condition classification
5. **Access Resources**: Use the sidebar for mental health resources, crisis helplines, and professional guidance

### Example Input:
```
I've been feeling really down lately and can't seem to find motivation for anything. 
Social media makes me feel worse about myself and I'm having trouble sleeping. 
Everything feels overwhelming and I just want to stay isolated from everyone.
```

### Classification Categories:
The model can classify text into various mental health condition categories based on patterns identified in social media and text data.
